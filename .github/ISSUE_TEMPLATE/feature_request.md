1. Name your feature request clearly including the plugin name.
2. Describe what extra feature you would like
3. Tell us whether you are willing to sponsor development of this feature, and if so, complete this form: https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/e/1FAIpQLSdeeKaTJIA5WgqF4X-9LsoGqSgyx1xeD_tABhiR86C7SwvOYQ/viewform?usp=sf_link&pli=1

**IMPORTANT**
If this feature is for a compatibility request, e.g. to make it compatible with X plugin, you must upload a copy of that plugin to some file sharing system and include a link to that here AND you must describe clear steps our developers can follow to configure the plugin to recreate the incompatibility you want fixed. If you cannot do this clearly, your feature request will be rejected unless you agree to sponsor the development.
